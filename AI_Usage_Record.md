## AI Usage Record

This document describes how AI tools (mainly ChatGPT / GPT-5) were used during the development of our Machine Learning Lifecycle project.

### 1. Planning and Structuring

AI was used to help interpret the assignment requirements and outline project steps.

### 2. Data Exploration and Preprocessing

We used AI for:

Designing reproducible preprocessing pipelines and avoiding data leakage.

We mostly used the slides and our previous knowledge for this section, but AI was occasionally used to aid us with our Python programming as we found ourselves a bit rusty to begin with.

All code was reviewed, tested, and adapted by the team.

### 3. Model Selection and Evaluation

AI assisted in:

Understanding key hyperparameters and validation strategies. 

We also found information through online tutorials and youtube videos that covered similar financial market based models.

Choosing and interpreting appropriate evaluation metrics.

We implemented and evaluated all models ourselves.

### 4. Documentation and Reflection

AI helped improve the clarity and flow of explanations in the notebook, rephrase technical sections, and ensure consistent formatting.
All conclusions and interpretations were written and verified by the team.

### 5. Summary

AI acted as a support tool for brainstorming, coding assistance, and writing guidance.
All project decisions, code implementations, and analyses were understood and validated by the group members.
